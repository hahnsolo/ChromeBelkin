A little home automation chrome plugin that can control Belkin Wemo controllers.

The appliction serves a few usecases as listed below 

1 . Intent 
 
 The chrome plugin shows the user the belkin wemo that is in the same room as they are and can turn on or off this wemo 
 based on user clicking the button.
 
 2 . Behavioural 
 
 The chrome plugin will inact certain behaviours based on broswer context ie. if the user were to navigate to a specific site 
 such as netflix... the application would turn off the wemo in th same location as the user.
 
 The application utilzes a custom version of ouimeaux plugin that is also forked on this page.
